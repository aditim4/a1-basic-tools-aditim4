Moore's law, conceived in 1965 by Gordon Moore, predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would double approximately every 12 months.This visualization represents the number of co mponents per integrated function for minimum cost per component extrapolated via time. The implication is that there has been an exponential growth in our ability to collect and record information in the digital form. This has been a defining characteristic of this age. In this era, exponential growth has been facilitated by advancements in technology especially because there has been an improvement in storage capacity, data transmission and the speed at which it has been transmitted. The improvement in computing capacity has been an important factor as well.

## Data Viz Biography

1. **Who or what institution produced the visualization?**
A: The source that produced the visualization is: Peter Bright, “Moore’s Law Really Is Dead This Time,” Ars Technica, February 10, 2016, https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/moores-law-really-is-dead-this-time/. Credit: Gordon Moore.

2. **When was it produced?**

A: 2/10/2016, 5:22 PM

3. **Who is the audience for the visualization?**

A: The audience could likely be semiconductor technology professionals or enthusiasts interested in the field of evolution of computing.


4. **How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**

A: The visualization can be interpreted as the exponential growth of semiconductor technology which has led to an exponential growth in data collection over the years. It can be misinterpreted due to the limitations of Moore's law leading to misinterpretations of technological prowess by the public.

5. **. How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**

A: The visualization represents the exponential growth of semiconductor technology and could be interpreted as one of the causes that there's been an exponential growth in data collection over the years.
