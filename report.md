There has been an exponential growth in our ability to collect and record information in the digital form. This has been a defining characteristic of this age. In this era of the digital age, exponential growth has been facilitated by advancements in technology especially because there has been an improvement in storage capacity, data transmission and the speed at which it has been transmitted. The improvement in computing capacity has been an important factor as well. Take for example, the 2019 Apple iPhone XR which had an impressive processing capability which exceeded 140 million instructions per second which is much more powerful than the capacity of a standard IBM System/360 from previous years.

## Data Viz Biography

1. **Who or what institution produced the visualization?**
A: The source that produced the visualization is: Peter Bright, “Moore’s Law Really Is Dead This Time,” Ars Technica, February 10, 2016, https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/moores-law-really-is-dead-this-time/. Credit: Gordon Moore.

2. **When was it produced?**

A: 2/10/2016, 5:22 PM

3. **Who is the audience for the visualization?**

A: The audience could likely be semiconductor technology professionals or enthusiasts interested in the field of evolution of computing.


4. **How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**

A: The visualization can be interpreted as the exponential growth of semiconductor technology which has led to an exponential growth in data collection over the years. It can be misinterpreted due to the limitations of Moore's law leading to misinterpretations of gtechnological prowess by the public.

5. **. How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**

A: The visualization represents the exponential growth of semiconductor technology and could be interpreted as one of the causes that there's been an exponential growth in data collection over the years.
